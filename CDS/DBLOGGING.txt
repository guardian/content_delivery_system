Logging to an external database with CDS 2.2.3 and higher
-------------------------------------------------------

Newer versions of CDS have the ability to output logging information to a database.  This has the advantage of using nicer tools to view status (Interactive Publisher and CDS Dashboards for example) especially across multiple servers and virtual node clusters.

To set this up, you need to do the following steps:
 1. Check your database server is correctly installed and set up
 2. Prep the database to receive data
 3. Adjust your CDS configuration to point to the database
 4. Duplicate the installation as required
 5. Install any dashboard software, webserver, etc. to make use of it

--------------------------------------------------------------

1. Check your database server is correctly installed and set up

The details of how to do this are beyond the scope of this document.
If you are not familiar with using databases, I would recommend that you use MySQL; it is network-capable, secure and fast without being overly complex.
Technically speaking, any system supported by the Perl DBI is compatible; proper testing has only been done on MySQL and PostGresQL though so your milage may vary on other systems.

The easiest way to do this is to get your sysadmin to do it for you, and use an existing database server.

If you are the sysadmin and still are not sure though,the easiest way to do this (on a Debian-based Linux system) is to run 'sudo apt-get install mysql-server'.  The RedHat equivalent is 'sudo yum install mysql-server'. If you're on a Mac, find the Mac package installer for your chosen database.
Installing an admin system like phpMyAdmin (MySQL)/phpPgAdmin (PostGresQL) on Apache is also highly recommended:
	sudo apt-get install phpMyAdmin apache
or
	sudo yum install phpMyAdmin apache

If you're installing fresh, part of the install will ask for a root password for the database.  Keep this for later, you'll need it!

You need to read the installation manuals for your chosen database, and ensure that it is set up to allow incoming TCP/IP connections and that the relevant users (see later)

--------------------------------------------------------------

2. Prep the database to receive data

The relevant schemae can be found in the db/ subdirectory of the CDS installation directory.

The easiest way to import these is via phpMyAdmin, phpPgAdmin or another admin UI if you have one available.
